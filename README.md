The premise of the game is to get rid of all of your cards in your hand, you do this while bluffing that you are putting down the correct card in order to the other players, while the other players are given a chance to call your bluff and have the player in the wrong (either the player bluffing, or the player who was wrong to call the bluff) pick up all the cards in the pile.
